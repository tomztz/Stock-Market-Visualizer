# Stock-Market-Visualizer
The main objective of the program is to give the user the most flexibility in displaying & seeing trends in a company’s stocks over a time period or at a certain date. This was achieved by giving the user three options – either to display a bar chart of various stocks at a time period, a line chart of the stocks over a period, or a simple company stocks page that shows statistics on a company’s performance.  The graphs could be manipulated by the user through their queries – for example, in the bar chart a user can specify that they want to see a stock’s volatility for a year compared to others, or in the line chart where a user can specify they want to see the changes in volume for multiple companies. Both the line chart and the bar chart would also display extra statistics to the user on the companies they selected – an attempt to give the user the best overview of a company.
